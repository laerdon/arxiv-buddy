Mark Dubowitz
(00:00:00) 
We want to avoid wars, we have to have serious deterrence because our enemies need to understand, we will use selective, focused, overwhelming military power when we are facing threats like an Iranian nuclear weapon.


Scott Horton
(00:00:12) 
I’m not seeing the peace through strength. I’m seeing permanent militarism and permanent war through strength.


Mark Dubowitz
(00:00:16) 
Do you ever hold our adversaries responsible or do you just don’t think we have any adversaries?


Scott Horton
(00:00:22) 
The easiest kind of nuke to make out of uranium is a simple gun type nuke.


Mark Dubowitz
(00:00:26) 
Are you saying that Mossad fabricated it?


Scott Horton
(00:00:29) 
Yeah.


Mark Dubowitz
(00:00:30) 
That’s what you’re claiming. Here’s the offer, take it to leave it. Zero enrichment full dismantlement.


Scott Horton
(00:00:34) 
Through the Iranians, told the IAEA, you can inspect any five out 10 facilities here, carte blanche, go ahead and they did and found nothing.


Mark Dubowitz
(00:00:41) 
Experts in Iran’s nuclear program, including David Albright, who actually saw the archive, went in there, wrote a whole book on it, and there’s a lot of detail about how Iran had an active nuclear weapons program called AMAD to build five nuclear weapons.


Scott Horton
(00:00:55) 
I have to refute virtually everything he just said, which is completely false.


Mark Dubowitz
(00:00:58) 
I mean really everything? There was not one thing I said that was true? Just one thing.


Scott Horton
(00:01:02) 
I mean Iran is a nation over there somewhere. You got that part right.


Mark Dubowitz
(00:01:05) 
22 years of working on Iran and I got that right.


Lex Fridman
(00:01:07) 
But do you know the population of Iran?


Mark Dubowitz
(00:01:09) 
92 million.


Lex Fridman
(00:01:10) 
Okay.


Scott Horton
(00:01:11) 
Give me a pound, dude.


Lex Fridman
(00:01:12) 
There we go, agreement.

Introduction

Lex Fridman
(00:01:16) 
The following is a debate between Scott Horton and Mark Dubowitz on the topic of Iran and Israel. Scott Horton is author and editorial director of Ntwar.com, host of the Scott Horton Show and for the past three decades, a staunch critic of US foreign policy and military interventionism. Mark Dubowitz is a chief executive of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, host of the Iran Breakdown Podcast, and he has been a leading expert on Iran and its nuclear program for over 20 years. This is the Lex Fridman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description and consider subscribing to this channel. If you do, I promise to work extremely hard to always bring you nuanced, long-form conversations with a very wide range of interesting people from all walks of life, and now, dear friends, here’s Scott Horton and Mark Dubowitz.

Iran-Israel War

Lex Fridman
(00:02:18) 
Gentlemen. All right, it’s great to have you here. Let’s try to have a nuanced discussion/debate and maybe even steal man-opposing perspectives as much as possible. All right, as a stands now, there’s a barely stable ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Let’s maybe rewind a little bit. Can we first lay out the context for this Iran-Israel war and try to describe the key events that happened over the past two weeks, maybe even a bit of the deep roots of the conflict?


Mark Dubowitz
(00:02:50) 
Sure. First of all, thanks so much for having me on. Great to be on with Scott. I know he and I don’t agree on a lot, but I certainly admire the passion and the dedication to stopping wars. So that’s something we want to talk about. So let’s talk about how we got to this war. So President Trump comes into office and immediately lays out that his Iran strategy is maximum pressure on the regime and he will not allow Iran to have a nuclear weapon, and he makes that clear. Consistently, I think made it very clear during his first term, made a clear throughout his career and thus begins this process with the Iranians, which has kind of multiple tracks, but the one that Trump sees most interested in at the time is the diplomatic track, and he makes it very clear from the beginning and a sort of Oval Office remark.



(00:03:38) 
He says the Iranians can either blow up their nuclear program under US supervision or someone’s going to blow it up for them, and even though at the time we think Netanyahu is really trying to push the president into a military campaign, well, I’m sure we’ll talk about that throughout the podcast. The president authorizes his lead negotiator and close friend Steve Witkoff to begin outreach to the Iranians, and that’s begun the Oman round and it’s Oman round because it’s taking place in Oman with mediation efforts by the Omanis. There are five rounds of negotiations with the Iranians, and through the course of those negotiations, the US finally puts on the table an offer for Iran. We’ll talk about the details of that. The Iranians reject that offer, and we’re now into the sixth round, which is supposed to take place on a Sunday. On the Thursday before the Sunday, the Israelis strike and they go after in a rather devastating campaign over a matter of now 12 days.



(00:04:42) 
They go over and go after Iran’s nuclear program, the key nuclear sites, going after weapons scientists who are responsible for building Iran’s nuclear weapons program and also go after top IRGC Islamic Revolutionary guard commanders as well as top military commanders, and yet there’s still this one site that is the most fortified site. It’s called Fordow. It’s an enrichment facility. It’s buried under a mountain, goes about 80 meters deep. It’s encased in concrete, it has advanced centrifuges and highly enriched uranium. The Israelis can do damage to it, but it’s clear it’s going to take the United States and our military power in order to severely degrade this facility, and Trump orders United States Air Force to fly B-II bombers and drop 12 massive ordnance penetrators, which are these 30,000 pound bombs on Fordow in order to, as he said, obliterate it, more realistically to severely degrade it. So that happens.



(00:05:46) 
And then he offers the Iranians as he’s been offering all the way through. You have an option, you can go back to Oman, I told you Oman, and you decided to force me to go to Fordow, but now we can go back for negotiations, and he forces a ceasefire on the Iranians, gets the Israelis to agree and that’s where we are today. That’s where as you say, a tentative ceasefire that just came into effect and we’ll see now if the Iranians decide to take President Trump on his repeated offers, join him in Oman for another round of negotiations. Scott, is there some stuff you want to add to that?


Scott Horton
(00:06:21) 
Sure. Well, he started with January, right? Trump’s second term here and the maximum pressure campaign essentially as should be clear to everyone. Now, all these negotiations were just a pretext for war. Trump and his entire cabinet must have known that the Ayatollah is not going to give up all enrichment. That is their latent nuclear deterrent. Their posture has been heavily implied, “Don’t attack us and we won’t make a nuke.” While America’s position was if you make a nuke, if you start to we’ll attack you. So it was the perfect standoff, but what happened was, and you might remember a few weeks ago, there was some talk about, “Well, maybe we could find a way to compromise on some enrichment. Maybe they could do a consortium with the Saudis.” And then nope, the pressure came down. No enrichment, zero enrichment, but that’s a red line.



(00:07:14) 
Everyone knows and even now it’s probably less likely than ever that they’re going to give up enrichment. Sure, they bombed Fordow, but they didn’t destroy every last centrifuge in that place, and the Iranians are already announcing that they’re already begun construction on another facility under a taller mountain buried even deeper, and they figured out how to enrich uranium hexafluoride gas, what, 20 years ago now, and they will always be able to, and this is the slippery slope that we’re on with these wars is in fact, I saw a friend here on TV the other day. He almost pretty much just implied there saying, “Well now Trump has to go in.” We were told it’s just Israel doing it, don’t worry, but then no Trump has to hit Fordow or else now they’ll break out toward a nuclear weapon. So in for a penny, in for a pound, in for a ton.



(00:08:09) 
And now once we bomb Fordow again and Natanz again and the new facility again, then it’ll be decided that nope, as Benjamin Netanyahu said the other day, you know what would really solve this problem? If we just kill the Ayatollah, then everything will be fine. Then we’ll have a regime change and then what? Then we’ll have a civil war with Bin Ladenites again in the catbird seat, just like George Bush put them in Iraq and Barack Obama, put them in Libya and in Syria, and we’ll have Azeris and Baluchi suicide bombers and Shiite revolutionaries and whoever all vying for power in the new absolute chaos stand.

Introduction

Lex Fridman
(00:00:00) 
The following is a conversation with Terence Tao, widely considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians in history, often referred to as The Mozart of Math. He won the Fields Medal and the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics, and has contributed groundbreaking work to a truly astonishing range of fields in mathematics and physics. This was a huge honor for me for many reasons, including the humility and kindness that Terry showed to me throughout all our interactions. It means the world. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description or at LexFridman.com/sponsors. And now, dear friends, here’s Terence Tao.

First hard problem

Lex Fridman
(00:00:49) 
What was the first really difficult research-level math problem that you encountered, one that gave you pause maybe?


Terence Tao
(00:00:57) 
Well, in your undergraduate education you learn about the really hard impossible problems like the Riemann Hypothesis, the Twin-Primes Conjecture. You can make problems arbitrarily difficult. That’s not really a problem. In fact, there’s even problems that we know to be unsolvable. What’s really interesting are the problems just on the boundary between what we can do rather easily and what are hopeless, but what are problems where existing techniques can do 90% of the job and then you just need that remaining 10%. I think as a PhD student, the Kakeya Problem certainly caught my eye. And it just got solved actually. It’s a problem I’ve worked on a lot in my early research. Historically, it came from a little puzzle by the Japanese mathematician Soichi Kakeya in 1918 or so. So, the puzzle is that you have a needle on the plane or think like driving on a road something, and you want it to execute a U-turn, you want to turn the needle around, but you want to do it in as little space as possible. So, you want to use this little area in order to turn it around, but the needle is infinitely maneuverable. So, you can imagine just spinning it around. As the unit needle, you can spin it around its center, and I think that gives you a disc of area, I think pi over four. Or you can do a three-point U-turn, which is what we teach people in their driving schools to do. And that actually takes area of pi over eight, so it’s a little bit more efficient than a rotation. And so for a while people thought that was the most efficient way to turn things around, but Besicovitch showed that in fact you could actually turn the needle around using as little area as you wanted. So, 0.01, there was some really fancy multi back and forth U-turn thing that you could do that you could turn a needle around and in so doing it would pass through every intermediate direction. Is


Lex Fridman
(00:02:51) 
This in the two-dimensional plane?


Terence Tao
(00:02:52) 
This is in the two-dimensional plane. So, we understand everything in two dimensions. So, the next question is: what happens in three dimensions? So, suppose the Hubble space Telescope is tube in space, and you want to observe every single star in the universe, so you want to rotate the telescope to reach every single direction. And here’s unrealistic part, suppose that space is at a premium, which totally is not, you want to occupy as little volume as possible in order to rotate your needle around, in order to see every single star in the sky. How small a volume do you need to do that? And so you can modify Besicovitch’s construction. And so if your telescope has zero thickness, then you can use as little volume as you need. That’s a simple modification of the two-dimensional construction. But the question is that if your telescope is not zero thickness, but just very, very thin, some thickness delta, what is the minimum volume needed to be able to see every single direction as a function of delta?



(00:03:45) 
So, as delta gets smaller, as the needle gets thinner, the volume should go down. But how fast does it go down? And the conjecture was that it goes down very, very slowly like logarithmically roughly speaking, and that was proved after a lot of work. So, this seems like a puzzle. Why is it interesting? So, it turns out to be surprisingly connected to a lot of problems in partial differential equations, in number theory, in geometry, combinatorics. For example, in wave propagation, you splash some water around, you create water waves and they travel in various directions, but waves exhibit both particle and wave-type behavior. So, you can have what’s called a wave packet, which is a very localized wave that is localized in space and moving a certain direction in time. And so if you plot it in both space and time, it occupies a region which looks like a tube. What can happen is that you can have a wave which initially is very dispersed, but it all focuses at a single point later in time. You can imagine dropping a pebble into a pond and the ripples spread out, but then if you time-reverse that scenario, and the equations of wave motion are time-reversible, you can imagine ripples that are converging to a single point and then a big splash occurs, maybe even a singularity. And so it’s possible to do that. And geometrically what’s going on is that there’s also light rays, so if this wave represents light, for example, you can imagine this wave as a superposition of photons all traveling at the speed of light.



(00:05:15) 
They all travel on these light rays and they’re all focusing at this one point. So, you can have a very dispersed wave focus into a very concentrated wave at one point in space and time, but then it de-focuses again, it separates. But potentially if the conjecture had a negative solution, so what that meant is that there’s a very efficient way to pack tubes pointing different directions to a very, very narrow region of a very narrow volume. Then you would also be able to create waves that start out some… There’ll be some arrangement of waves that start out very, very dispersed, but they would concentrate, not just at a single point, but there’ll be a lot of concentrations in space and time. And you could create what’s called a blowup, where these waves amplitude becomes so great that the laws of physics that they’re governed by are no longer wave equations, but something more complicated and nonlinear.

Navier–Stokes singularity


(00:06:08) 
And so in mathematical physics, we care a lot about whether certain equations and wave equations are stable or not, whether they can create these singularities. There’s a famous unsolved problem called the Navier-Stokes regularity problem. So, the Navier-Stokes equations, equations that govern the fluid flow for incompressible fluids like water. The question asks: if you start with a smooth velocity field of water, can it ever concentrate so much that the velocity becomes infinite at some point? That’s called a singularity. We don’t see that in real life. If you splash around water in the bathtub, it won’t explode on you or have water leaving at the speed of light or anything, but potentially it is possible.



(00:06:49) 
And in fact, in recent years, the consensus has drifted towards the belief that, in fact, for certain very special initial configurations of, say, water, that singularities can form, but people have not yet been able to actually establish this. The Clay Foundation has these seven Millennium Prize Problems as a $1 million prize for solving one of these problems, and this is one of them. Of these of these seven, only one of them has been solved, at the Poincare Conjecture [inaudible 00:07:18]. So, the Kakeya Conjecture is not directly directly related to the Navier-Stokes Problem, but understanding it would help us understand some aspects of things like wave concentration, which would indirectly probably help us understand the Navier-Stokes Problem better.


Lex Fridman
(00:07:32) 
Can you speak to the Navier-Stokes? So, the existence of smoothness, like you said, Millennium Prize Problem, You’ve made a lot of progress on this one. In 2016, you published a paper, Finite Time Blowup For An Average Three-Dimensional Navier-Stokes Equation. So, we’re trying to figure out if this thing… Usually it doesn’t blow up, but can we say for sure it never blows up?


Terence Tao
(00:07:56) 
Right, yeah. So yeah, that is literally the $1 million question. So, this is what distinguishes mathematicians from pretty much everybody else. If something holds 99.99% of the time, that’s good enough for most things. But mathematicians are one of the few people who really care about whether really 100% of all situations are covered by it. So, most fluid, most of the time water does not blow up, but could you design a very special initial state that does this?


Lex Fridman
(00:08:29) 
And maybe we should say that this is a set o...","{""title"": ""#472 – Terence Tao: Hardest Problems in Mathematics, Physics & the Future of AI"", ""scraped_at"": ""2025-07-06T18:04:35.426004"", ""content_length"": 204080, ""episode_number"": 472}",2025-07-06 18:04:35.695367+00,2025-07-06 18:04:35.695367+00,Lex Fridman Podcast
